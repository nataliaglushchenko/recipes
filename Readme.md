## Description:

This application is built on *React* and *Webpack 5*, utilizing various libraries and techniques. For managing asynchronous data fetching and storage, I implemented the *Redux Toolkit*'s recommended API approach, along with *GraphQL* to query data from the Contentful API. The methods are stored in the `service` folder. Styling was achieved using the Bootstrap and Reactstrap libraries. The application features two pages, a preview page at `/recipes` and a detail view at `/recipes/some-recipe-id`, both of which are accessible through their respective URLs handled by *react-router-dom*.
